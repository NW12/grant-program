### Overview

Please provide the following:
- MetaMuto is a non-custodial wallet based on the VeChain Blockchain. It is one of the first wallets with an interactive user interface and allows users a lot of modules under one roof. The MutoWallet allows holding NFTs, Fungible Tokens, Staking Tokens till Swapping them right within our application. Similarly, we tend to offer a much more minimalist extension from where users can view their quick assets etc. Muto Wallet will also comprise of on-ramp Crypto Buying solutions as well.

- We are interested in building onto VeChain for the following reasons:
1) Strong Community
2) Fee Delegation System
3) Fast and Amplified Transactions
4) Low to minimalist Gas-Fee
5) Recognized Team with a strong background.

- We will integrate the VIP Contract Standards ( 180 & 181 ) to hold and transfer fungible and non-fungible thokens. Similarly, Thorify adapter will be used for Web 3.0 connectivity.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- API specifications of the core functionality:

1) Front-End : React, JavaScript, Thorify Web 3 Library,
2) Smart Contract : Solidity, Hardhat, Typescript. VIP (180 and 181)
3) Architecture - Load Balancers, AWS with EC2

### Ecosystem Fit
As of now, we only have the VeChain Sync wallet but our wallet is super advance in features. We have created a whole new Wallet that allows users to hold their non-fungible and fugnible assets at one place. Similarly, we are offering a staking module where users can access pools and services under one-roof. Our Wallet also features an integrated swap. The best part is that MetaMuto Wallet also allows holding game/metaverse tokens too separately.  We also offer a chrome extension where users can have a quick overview about their assets and can perform small actions from there
