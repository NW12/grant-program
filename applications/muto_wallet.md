The MutoWallet allows holding NFTs, Fungible Tokens, Staking Tokens till Swapping them right within our application. Similarly, we tend to offer a much more minimalist extension from where users can view their quick assets etc. Muto Wallet will also comprise of on-ramp Crypto Buying solutions as well.
